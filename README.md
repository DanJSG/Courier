This is a full stack web development project where I plan to create a messaging web app.

## Technologies

Front-end: ReactJS with SCSS \
Back-end: Java (probably with Spring framework) \
Database: MongoDB for messages/chats, MySQL for user accounts, authentication etc. 

## Things to explore

Messages DB is implemented using MongoDB. I have read about scaling issues once you have very large amounts of data. I should investigate whether Cassandra would be a good alternative for this.

## Further aspirations

I would like to write some C++ for potentially slow operations (search, cryptography etc.) but unsure as of yet whether this is a good idea or not.

I would love to use the tensorflow library (or some other ML library) for Python with the chat data to see if anything interesting can be done there eg. chat bot, learning predictive suggestions etc.
