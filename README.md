# Courier

This is a full stack web development project (that has only just been started) where I plan to create a messaging web app.

## Technologies

Front-end: ReactJS with SCSS
Back-end: Java (probably with Spring framework)
Database: MongoDB for messages/chats, MySQL for user accounts, authentication etc.

## Further aspirations

I would like to write some C++ for potentially slow operations (search, cryptography etc.) but unsure as of yet whether this is a good idea or not.

I would love to use the tensorflow library (or some other ML library) for Python with the chat data to see if anything interesting can be done there eg. chat bot, learning predictive suggestions etc.
