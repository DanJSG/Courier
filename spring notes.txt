Spring notes:

	If you are getting a CORS error when making an API request it may be being caused by the Content-Type headers not being set properly in the request.
	
	If you are getting null for a repository or something similar, this is probably because it is being implemented like this:
	
		Repository repo = new Repository()
		
	Or because one of its parent classes is being instantiated like this.

	To solve this, use the autowired annotation:
	
		@Autowired
		Repository repo;
		
		Getting started with Spring:

	-> Initialise project at https://start.spring.io/
	-> Extract files from Zip
	-> In Eclipse, import an existing Maven project
	-> Make sure to uncomment spring-boot-starter-data-jpa or errors will occur
	-> Create a run configuration with the following:
		- Base Directory: ${project_loc:<PROJECT NAME>}
		- Goals: spring-boot:run
