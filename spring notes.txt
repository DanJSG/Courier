Spring notes:

	If you are getting null for a repository or something similar, this is probably because it is being implemented like this:
	
		Repository repo = new Repository()
		
	Or because one of its parent classes is being instantiated like this.
	
	To solve this, use the autowired annotation:
	
		@Autowired
		Repository repo;
